## About This Fork

This project is a fork of [SudokuEink by ktacrack](https://github.com/ktacrack/SudokuEink), branching off from version 1.5.1. The first release of this fork is `0.1.0`. 

This fork exists because the HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) and model-selection changes are broad enough that they are not currently suitable as a small upstream pull request. If useful, individual changes may be proposed upstream later.

The original app is fantastic, but we pursued a different vision and philosophy for e-ink devices that led to many breaking changes. Our primary focus is a **stylus-first, paper-like experience**, allowing handwritten inputs directly on the board and heavily reducing screen refreshes to minimize e-ink ghosting. We are deeply grateful to the original author for their foundation.

*Note: Most code changes in this fork were made with the help of AI.*

## Key Changes & Philosophy

### Stylus-First & Paper-Like Experience
- **Direct Handwriting:** You can write digits directly onto the board. Your original handwritten strokes persist throughout the game instead of immediately converting to a typed font, maintaining a natural paper feel.
- **E-ink Optimized UI:** The UI has been heavily altered to use a high-contrast, strictly black-and-white palette (utilizing the Mudita UI package). This reduces the need for constant screen refreshes and minimizes e-ink ghosting.
- **Flattened Menus:** We flattened many previous distinct menus and moved settings into a central place, freeing the main game screen from side interactions.
- **Action-First Game UX:** The board is cleaner with no background. Button behavior is now "action-first" – you tap a tool (like a digit or eraser), then tap the cell to apply it. We eliminated dynamic highlights to further reduce screen flashes and ghosting.

### Enhanced Handwriting Recognition Models
We've integrated new, more precise models for handwriting recognition, providing an improved stylus experience.

## Handwriting recognition models

| Model | Source | License | Distributed in APK? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Original TFLite model | original SudokuEink | MIT / upstream | yes | inherited from upstream |
| ONNX Model | Microsoft | AGPL 3.0 | no / downloaded by user | user must accept terms |
| Google ML Kit | Google | Apache 2.0 | no / downloaded by user | user must accept terms |

## Known Bugs & Issues
- **Dark Mode:** Dark mode is currently not working and the toggle has been disabled in settings.
- **Screen Orientation:** When switching screen orientation (e.g., portrait to landscape), handwritten notes may not align correctly with the cells.
- **Device Support:** Currently tested only on the Onyx Boox Max3 (13.3").
